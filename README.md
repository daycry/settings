# CodeIgniter 4 Settings

Provides database storage and retrieval of application settings, with a fallback to the 
config classes.

## Quick Start

1. Install with Composer: `> composer require daycry/settings`
2. Create a new migration and copy the provided class from below into it.

`Settings` provides a simple interface that you can use in place of calling `config()` to allow you to read and store
config values in the database. If the value has not been updated and saved in the database then the original value
from the config file will be used.

This allows you to save your application's default state as values in config files, all stored in version control,
and still allows your users to override those settings once the site is live. 

## Installation

Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities
and always be up-to-date:
* `> composer require daycry/settings`

## Manual installation

Download this repo and then enable it by editing **app/Config/Autoload.php** and adding the **Daycry\Settings**
namespace to the **$psr4** array. For example, if you copied it into **app/ThirdParty**:

```php
$psr4 = [
    'Config'      => APPPATH . 'Config',
    APP_NAMESPACE => APPPATH,
    'App'         => APPPATH,
    'Daycry\Settings' => APPPATH .'ThirdParty/settings/src',
];
```

## Setup

Run command:

	> php spark settings:publish

This command will copy a config file to your app namespace.
Then you can adjust it to your needs. By default file will be present in `app/Config/Settings.php`.

In order to store the settings in the database, you can run the provided migration: 

```
> php spark migrate --all
```

This will also migrate all other packages. If you don't want to do that you can copy the file
from `vendor/daycry/settings/src/Database/Migrations/2021-09-01-000001_CreateSettingsTable.php`
into `app/Database/Migrations`, and migrate without the `--all` flag.

## dot Notation

This library uses what we call "dot notation" to specify the class name and the property name to use.
These are joined by a dot, hence the name. 

If you have a class named `App`, and the property you are wanting to use is `siteName`, then the key
would be `App.siteName`.

## Usage

To retrieve a config value use the `settings` service. 

```php
// The same as config('App')->siteName;
$siteName = service('settings')->get('App.siteName');
```

In this case we used the short class name, `App`, which the `config()` method automatically locates within the 
`app/Config` directory. If it was from a module, it would be found there. Either way, the fully qualified name
is automatically detected by the Settings class to keep values separated from config files that may share the 
same name but different namespaces. If no config file match is found, the short name will be used, so it can
be used to store settings without config files. 

To save a value, call the `set()` method on the settings class, providing the class name, the key, and the value.
Note that boolean `true`/`false` will be converted to strings `:true` and `:false` when stored in the database, but
will be converted back into a boolean when retrieved. Arrays and objects are serialized when saved, and unserialized
when retrieved. 

```php
service('setting')->set('App.siteName', 'My Great Site');
```

You can delete a value from the persistent storage with the `forget()` method. Since it is removed from the storage,
it effectively resets itself back to the default value in config file, if any.

```php
service('setting')->forget('App.siteName')
```

### Using the Helper

The helper provides a shortcut to the using the service. It must first be loaded using the `helper()` method
or telling your BaseController to always load it.

```php
helper('setting');

$name = setting('App.siteName');
// Store a value
setting('App.siteName', 'My Great Site');

// Using the service through the helper
$name = setting()->get('App.siteName');
setting()->set('App.siteName', 'My Great Site');

// Forgetting a value
setting()->forget('App.siteName');
```

## Known Limitations

The following are known limitations of the library:

1. Using the `setting()` helper method does not support setting a `null` value on a property. For most cases, you are 
better off forgetting the value or setting it to an empty string. If you need to, you can set it by grabbing 
the service and using the `set()` method:

```php
service('settings')->set('App.siteName', null);
setting()->set('App.siteName', null);
```

2. You can currently only store a single setting at a time. While the `DatabaseHandler` uses a local cache to
keep performance as high as possible for reads, writes must be done one at a time. 
3. You can only access the first level within a property directly. In most config classes this is a non-issue, 
since the properties are simple values. Some config files, like the `database` file, contain properties that
are arrays.
